## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of an MBA in Data Analytics & Business Intelligence 360°.
The main goal was to identify operational bottlenecks in a simulated manufacturing company (Xperiun),
focusing on process delays, sector performance, and financial impact.

## Business Objectives
- Improve operational efficiency  
- Reduce order cycle time  
- Enhance customer SLA performance  
- Support data-driven decision-making  

## Data Sources
The analysis was based on operational system data, including:
- Orders
- Production process flow
- Departments and workstations
- Employees
- Materials and product complexity

## Key Insights
- Actual execution time frequently exceeds standard time, especially in:
  - Machining
  - Cutting
  - Welding
- Recurrent issues such as:
  - Operator unavailability
  - Machine breakdowns
- High-complexity and heavy-weight orders account for most delays and rework

## Proposed Improvements
Based on the analysis, the following actions were recommended:
- Strategic resource reallocation
- Feasibility analysis for new machine acquisition
- Workforce optimization, prioritizing critical departments

## Deliverables
- Interactive dashboards developed in **Power BI**
- KPIs for monitoring operational delays and bottlenecks
- Visual insights to support management decision-making

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- Data Modeling
- DAX
- Business Intelligence concepts
- Process analysis

## Project Structure
- `/powerbi`: Power BI dashboard file (.pbix)
- `/docs`: Dashboard screenshots
- `/data`: Sample or anonymized data (optional)

## 📎 Notes
This project uses simulated data for academic and portfolio purposes.
